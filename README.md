## NukeDiscordBot
### Description
A music discord bot that downloads mp3 from youtube using the url entered in the command and plays it in the discord voice channel.  
In the application configuration, you can set the token of your discord bot, a command prefix, a custom path for saving mp3s and a caching flag.  
If the caching flag is turned off, then mp3 will be deleted every time, which means that when the same videos are launched, mp3 will be downloaded every time. If the caching flag is turned on, the file will remain and the music will be restarted without downloading.
### List of commands:  
* !p {{youtube_url}} 
* !s
